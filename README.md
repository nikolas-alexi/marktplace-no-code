## 📚 Based On

This app was developed following the **Renato Asse’s course** on Bubble, but I went beyond the tutorials, customizing and applying the lessons in real scenarios.

## 🧠 About the Project

The goal was to practice and prove I can go from zero to a functional MVP using no-code tools. There were bugs, challenges, and lots of learning — but most importantly: **it was built and shipped**.
